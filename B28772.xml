            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offer'd to the Honourable House of COMMONS, by the Church Wardens and other Inhabitants of the Citty and Libertie of <hi>Westminster;</hi> Against Passing the BILL to Exempt <hi>Apothecaries</hi> from Serving Parish and Ward-Offices.</head>
            <p>THat by Reason of the great Numbers of Kings Servants, Justices of the Peace, Kings, and Militia Officers, Physitians, Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Attornies, Chyrurgions, Kings Pensioners, Roman Catholicks, Widows, and poor Inhabitants in the Citty and Libertie of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi> It is very difficult to find a sufficient Number of Substantiall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, sit to serve the several Parish and Ward Offices, which Number Yearly being very great, forces the Ancient Inhabitants of each Parish, to choose many times very mean Trades whose Education generally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them unfit for such Offices, and their Necessity may constrain them to Act contrary to their Honest Inclination.</p>
            <p>And tho' the said Ancients of each Parish do Endeavour to avoyd the choosing Vintners, and Victullers, (of which there is a very great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in this Libertie) by reason their Profession naturally tends to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Mony. Yet they are necessitated sometimes to choose them, which has given a most just and vniversall Complaint, tho' it cannot be avoided, having no better Inhabitants liable to be chosen for Parish Officers. And the Parish of St. <hi>Paul Covent-Garden</hi> have in the last Seven Years for want of others, courted the Constables, Surveyours of the Highways, and Scavengers, each to serve Two Years together, the Overseer Four Years, and one Church-Warden Six Years, and the other Seven Years.</p>
            <p>That the Apothecaries Trades are as much managed by Journymen, and Apprentices, both at Home and Abroad, as any, and they are as much Absent from their Shops, at Taverns, Coffee Houses, Country-House, Governing in Vestrys, Choosiing Officers, Sheriffs, Lord Mayors, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament; in all which Honourable, and Profitable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they never refuse to serve themselves, from which they ought —as well to be exempted, as from Parish and Ward-Offices.</p>
            <p>That their Profession requires such Education, as better Qualifies them to do good in serving Parish and Ward-Offices, than any other Trade, and if there has been any Mismanagement in Parish Government, as has been by them Insiuated; it would be for a general good, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been Seven Years Excused, they now might come in and Rectify such Ill Government.</p>
            <p>That the Profit of their Trades are so much Superior to any other, and Sunday to them an equall day of gain, with the rest of the Weekdays; therefore they may better bear with the loss of Time and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance such Offices do require, than any other Trade whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which is Humbly Submitted to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this Honourable House.</hi>
